# Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of objects, which bundle properties and methods together.

It promotes code reusability, Modularity and scalability.
# Key principles of Object-Oriented Programming

**Encapsulation** :  This is bundling data and methods into a single unit (Object).

**Abstraction**: Abstraction is hiding implementation details and exposing only what is necessary.

**Inheritance**:Inheritance is creating new objects based on existing ones.
 
**Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability to exist in more than one form.

Objects can share the same method but behave differently.
