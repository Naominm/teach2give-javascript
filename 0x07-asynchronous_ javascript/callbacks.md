# Callbacks
Callbacks are one of the solutions for asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

```js
 function fetchData() {
    let data = { username: "carl peters", role: "user" };
    return data;
}

function showData(data) {
    console.log(`Username is ${data.username} and role is ${data.role}`);
}

const userData = fetchData();
showData(userData)
```

**output**
```html
Username is carl peters and role is user
```

 fetching data takes time, like when calling an API or reading from a database

 setTimeout() delays execution of the function, making it asynchronous.

 fetchData() does not wait for the data to be readyâ€”it returns undefined immediately.

 When showData(userData) runs, userData is undefined, leading to errors.

 ## callback Function
 A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, ensuring that execution happens only after the asynchronous operation is complete.

 ```js
     function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    let data = { username: "carl peters", role: "Admin" };
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}

fetchData(function (data) {
  console.log(`Username is ${data.username} and role is ${data.role}`);
});
```

fetching data with multiple data points:

The indentation (callback hell) keeps increasing making the code harder to read.

Difficult debugging: If something goes wrong, finding the issue in nested callbacks is frustrating.

To avoid callback hell, we can replace callbacks with Promises, which provide better structure and readability.
